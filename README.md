This project involves predicting student grades using a dataset containing information like nationality, city, age, and gender. The data was preprocessed with label encoding for categorical variables. A Random Forest Regressor was implemented using scikit-learn to build a predictive model. Model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score, showing slight improvements.
